## AI

## Tutorials
https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore -> seems like a really in depth tutorial of vim
## Find and Replace
https://www.mattlayman.com/blog/2019/supercharging-vim-blazing-fast-search/ -> article about quickfix reflector
https://github.com/stefandtw/quickfix-reflector.vim -> this is to be used with other alternatives as it allows to make the quick fix list writable!
https://github.com/mhinz/vim-grepper -> together with the above might be a nice solution
https://github.com/dyng/ctrlsf.vim#quick-start -> this is a all in one plugin for searching and replacing
https://github.com/brooth/far.vim -> same as above
https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc -> this guy uses vim-grepper and some other crazy key bindings (maybe could be made easier if he used quickfix-reflector
## Testing
https://github.com/janko/vim-test -> This sounds AMAZING
## Tmux alternatives
http://www.brain-dump.org/projects/abduco/ for session storage
http://www.brain-dump.org/projects/dvtm/ for tiling window
