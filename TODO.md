# Vim 
## Tutorials
https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore -> seems like a really in depth tutorial of vim
## Find and Replace
https://www.mattlayman.com/blog/2019/supercharging-vim-blazing-fast-search/ -> article about quickfix reflector
https://github.com/stefandtw/quickfix-reflector.vim -> this is to be used with other alternatives as it allows to make the quick fix list writable!
https://github.com/mhinz/vim-grepper -> together with the above might be a nice solution
https://github.com/dyng/ctrlsf.vim#quick-start -> this is a all in one plugin for searching and replacing
https://github.com/brooth/far.vim -> same as above
https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc -> this guy uses vim-grepper and some other crazy key bindings (maybe could be made easier if he used quickfix-reflector
## Git integration
https://github.com/lambdalisue/gina.vim  -> new stuff!! seems promising
https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit
https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter
https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify
https://github.com/neoclide/coc-git -> maybe delete this dependency as well and let COC just handle LSP stuff and not really git stuff
## Floating windows
https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap -> maybe this can be used to replace fzf window code on my vimrc?
## Testing!
https://github.com/janko/vim-test -> This sounds AMAZING
## MRU
https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim -> maybe just user ctrlP for this and let fzf do everything else
## Start up screen
