# dotfiles

Welcome to my humble dotfiles repo.

This was done with a lot of love and I occasionally update it.

# Install

First run install script `./install` to set up the install scripts
Switch over to zsh or even better make it your default one `sudo chsh $(which zsh)`
Reload the shell now using zsh
go into the dotfiles repo and run the command `dotfiles_update` which is an alias to setup git submodules

For mac I recommend installing iterm2 as well as Fira Code font.

# Features

This uses the amazing dotbot to handle all the symlinking.
These dotfiles are mainly for zsh, vim and space-macs (though I haven't been using emacs for a while now).

# Support

For now this works on linux/mac and windows (via WSL only)
If you have any questions please feel free to open an Issue
